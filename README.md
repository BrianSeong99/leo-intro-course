# leo-intro-course

**Welcome to the "leo-intro-course" repo, your gateway to mastering the Leo language and exploring the Aleo ecosystem.** 

This repo is specially designed for developers interested in developing on Aleo blockchain, but it's also a fantastic resource for anyone interested in blockchain and Leo programming.

Our Repo is continuously evolving. Upcoming tasks include completing more advanced units, recording instructional videos, and compiling a comprehensive list of FAQs and collection of all Aleo workshops developed by our communities.

**We're excited to have you here and can't wait to see what you build with Leo!**

#### *For in person Learn & Earn Workshop Participants*

Please fork it first to your own github account, clone it to your local device, then start working on finishing Unit One of the course. Make sure you push everything to your forked repo to show that you have finished the workshops. All instructions are showed in below [`Leo from 0 to Hero - Unit One`](#markdown-header-basics).
