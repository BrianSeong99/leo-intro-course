# 6 CHALLENGE for Unit One

## Introduction
There has been tons of discussion about what should be included for ARC20 design, for reference please check out [here](https://github.com/AleoHQ/ARCs/discussions/42).

Whether to make a most basic implementation of ARC20 and later add features with future proposals, or include some Aleo exclusive features that makes the best use of Aleo blockchain's capabilities, there is still not an answer to this yet.

## Task
Come join our discussion in the github discussion page, brainstorm, participate, and proposal your ideas/thoughts! (Reference: [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/))
